Development Considerations:
------------------------
        Architecture: 
Decide on a monolithic vs. microservices architecture based on capabilities and the expected scale.
------------------------
        Tech Stack: 
For the backend, Python (using Django or Flask). For the frontend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Considering using frameworks like React or Vue.js for a dynamic user experience.
------------------------
        Database: 
Choose between SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) based on data structure and scalability needs.
------------------------
        APIs: 
Design RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend. Ensure they are secure and efficient.
------------------------
        Testing: 
Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability.
------------------------
        Deployment: 
Plan for deployment on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for scalability and reliability.
